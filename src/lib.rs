//! Turmoil is a framework for testing distributed systems. It provides
//! deterministic execution by running multiple concurrent hosts within a single
//! thread. It introduces "hardship" into the system via changes in the
//! simulated network. The network can be controlled manually or with a seeded
//! rng.
//!
//! # Hosts and Software
//!
//! A turmoil simulation is comprised of one or more hosts. Hosts run software,
//! which is represented as a `Future`.
//!
//! Test code is also executed on a special host, called a client. This allows
//! for an entry point into the simulated system. Client hosts have all the same
//! capabilities as normal hosts, such as networking support.
//!
//! ```
//! use turmoil;
//!
//! let mut sim = turmoil::Builder::new().build();
//!
//! // register a host
//! sim.host("host", || async {
//!
//!     // host software goes here
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! });
//!
//! // define test code
//! sim.client("test", async {
//!
//!     // we can interact with other hosts from here
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! });
//!
//! // run the simulation and handle the result
//! _ = sim.run();
//!
//! ```
//!
//! # Networking
//!
//! Simulated networking types that mirror `tokio::net` are included in the
//! `turmoil::net` module.
//!
//! Turmoil is not yet oppinionated on how to structure your application code to
//! swap in simulated types under test. More on this coming soon...
//!
//! # Network Manipulation
//!
//! The simulation has the following network manipulation capabilities:
//!
//! * [`partition`], which introduces a network partition between hosts
//! * [`repair`], which repairs a network partition between hosts
//! * [`hold`], which holds all "in flight" messages between hosts. Messages are
//!   available for introspection using [`Sim`]'s `links` method.
//! * [`release`], which releases all "in flight" messages between hosts
//!
//! # Tracing
//!
//! The `tracing` crate is used to emit important events during the lifetime of
//! a simulation. To enable traces, your tests must install a
//! [`tracing-subscriber`](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/).
//! The log level of turmoil can be configured using `RUST_LOG=turmoil=info`.
//!
//! It is possible to configure your tracing subscriber to log elapsed
//! simulation time instead of real time. See the grpc example.
//!
//! Turmoil can provide a full packet level trace of the events happening in a
//! simulation by passing `RUST_LOG=turmoil=trace`. This is really useful
//! when you are unable to identify why some unexpected behaviour is happening
//! and you need to know which packets are reaching where.
//!
//! To see this in effect, you can run the axum example with the following
//! command:
//!
//! ```bash
//! RUST_LOG=INFO,turmoil=TRACE cargo run -p axum-example
//! ```
//!
//! You can see the TCP packets being sent and delivered between the server
//! and the client:
//!
//! ```bash
//! ...

//! Here the server is sending a response, before it is delivered to, and

//! trace in turmoil. We see `Send` when a packet is sent from one address
//! to another. The packet is then `Delivered` to its destination, and when
//! the destination reads the packet it is `Recv`'d.
